{"pred": "\n\nAcute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare and mysterious illness that has been on the rise again, two years after an outbreak alarmed doctors and parents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been 50 cases of AFM reported across 24 states this year, which is more than double the number of cases reported in 2015. The illness affects the spinal cord, and the exact trigger is often elusive, with no specific treatment available. Related enteroviruses, such as enterovirus D68, have been linked to AFM, but no causal relationship has been substantiated. The CDC advises parents to keep their children up-to-date on vaccinations and protect them from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The illness seemed to peak in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December, all of which were children. Laura Carson, a healthy, active 4-year-old, suddenly developed AFM in 2014, and her mother Sara Carson shared their story with TODAY. The family tried to adjust to a new reality, with Laura receiving intensive physical, speech, and occupational therapy, and she is now doing much better.

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

According to a new paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, causing distant stars to become inaccessible to advanced civilizations in the future. To prevent this, advanced civilizations may capture stars from other galaxies and reel them in to harvest their energy before they become permanently inaccessible. The paper also mentions the concept of Dyson spheres, a swarm of satellites that could be used to harness energy from a star. The article also references a collection of outsider-uploaded WARCs, called WARCZone, which are being kept for reference and clarity for the Wayback Team, while also being accessible to the general public.\n\nIn addition, the article mentions the idea of Type I, II, and III civilizations proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, which classify advanced civilizations based on their ability to harness energy from their planet, star, or galaxy. The article also mentions the concept of solar sails, which could be used to hover in space and collect energy from a star.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

In this article, we take a look at the show's history, from its early days to its current success. We also explore the show's impact on politics and society, as well as the personal stories of the show's correspondents and staff.\n\nEarly Days:\nThe Daily Show was created in 1996 by comedian Jon Stewart, who was then a correspondent on Comedy Central's The Late Show with Craig Kilborn. Stewart wanted to create a show that would provide a satirical take on the day's news, rather than just a straightforward news program. The show's first few years were marked by a lack of resources and a small budget, but Stewart's comedic talent and the show's unique format quickly gained it a following.\n\nField Pieces:\nOne of the show's most popular features is its field pieces, where correspondents travel to different locations to report on a particular story or issue. These pieces are often marked by their humor and satire, and have been known to make politicians and other public figures uncomfortable. The show's correspondents, including Steve Carell, Mo Rocca, and Samantha Bee, have become well-known for their ability to ask tough questions and make fun of the absurdity of politics.\n\nImpact on Politics and Society:\nThe Daily Show has had a significant impact on politics and society, both in the United States and around the world. The show's satirical take on current events has helped to hold politicians and other public figures accountable for their actions, and has provided a platform for marginalized voices to be heard. The show has also been credited with helping to increase political engagement and voter turnout, particularly among young people.\n\nPersonal Stories:\nThe show's correspondents and staff have also shared their personal stories of how The Daily Show has impacted their lives. For example, Steve Carell has spoken about how the show helped him to find his comedic voice, while Samantha Bee has talked about how it gave her the opportunity to become a political commentator.

The study found evidence of long-distance trade and exchange of raw materials, including obsidian, which was brought from 25-50 km away and some from further afield. The findings suggest that early humans were more mobile, information-gathering, and innovative in response to environmental changes. The study also found that the earliest evidence of pigment use, including bright red ochre, was discovered at the site. The discovery challenges the traditional view of a \"human revolution\" 40,0000-50,000 years ago and suggests that modern behaviors arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The parole board's decision will be announced immediately after the hearing, and if granted parole, Simpson will be released from prison no sooner than Oct. 1. Simpson's friend, Tom Pitaro, has argued that Simpson deserves parole, citing his good behavior in prison and his remorse for the armed heist of memorabilia collectors. However, the Las Vegas jury's anger over Simpson's book, \"If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer,\" could work against him. The book was changed to If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer after Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Brown and Goldman in a civil suit. Media interest in the hearing is overwhelming, with 30 media organizations registering to attend and broadcast the hearing live. The hearing will be teleconferenced to the board in Carson City, where four members of the Parole Board will deliberate in private before taking a public vote. If the vote is unanimous in favor of parole, Simpson will be released this fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "answers": ["OJ Simpson's parole hearing in Nevada will be broadcast live at 1pm EDT Thursday and there's a strong chance that his path to freedom will be clear by the end of the afternoon.

The law makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a petty offense that could result in a fine but not in a criminal record. The law also permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The legislation paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. The move comes after decades of debate and follows changes to drug laws in U.S. states. Jamaica's national security minister, Peter Bunting, said the legislation does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The law also holds great potential for Jamaica, where marijuana has long been grown illegally on mountainsides and marshes. The legislation also adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 U.S. states allow some form of medical marijuana and last year Colorado and Washington legalized personal use. On Tuesday, Alaska became the third U.S. state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults. In the Americas, Uruguay last year became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market. In Argentina, personal possession of marijuana was decriminalized under a 2009 Supreme Court ruling that jail time for small amounts of drugs violates the country's constitution. A law in Chile permits use of medical marijuana.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.

The study suggests that the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface. This discovery supports the idea that life might have existed on Mars in the past. Additionally, the study found that Earth and Mars had identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water, but on Mars, the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into space. This means that Mars now has a higher proportion of deuterium in its water than Earth does, which can be used to estimate how much water there used to be on the planet.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The study, conducted by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University in Arizona, Memorial University of University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah, analyzed the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups. The research found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds and crocodiles.

The occurrence of closed-mouth vocalization across birds and crocodiles suggests that it can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances. The study offers clues about what non-avian dinosaurs sounded like, as they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked.
