{"pred": "Based on the meeting transcript, B thought that the experimental setup of the computer navigation system was separate and did not have a real tight time frame for delivery. B also mentioned that they would be like hand doing all the probabilities until they know more about the system.", "answers": ["B explained that the subject of the experiment will first be given texts about a city, so they can familiarize themselves with foreign terms. Then, they will be introduced to a computer navigation system with which they can navigate the city and provided with a set of tasks to complete. Then, the computer system will crash, including the GPS, so the person will not even know where they are, and the human operator will assist them. To find their location, the subject will have to provide visual information to the human operator. B also thought that creating movies of walking would require a lot of technical effort but later claimed that it may be worth it. B clarified that the goal was to see how people communicate in such a scenario."], "all_classes": null, "length": 15412}

On the other hand, it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now, as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on."], "all_classes": null, "length": 24585}
{"pred": "The meeting was focused on evaluating the design of a remote control for a television. The team discussed the design, including the use of a joystick, buttons, and a LCD display.

They also discussed the leadership and teamwork during the project.", "answers": ["Firstly, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was half rubber and half plastic with a yellow case. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the market trend as well as the customers' taste and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product.Thirdly, the team found that the current product exceeded the budget, so the team decided to discard joystick and use only one material with the normal color but the team agreed to keep the LCD as well as the advanced chips.

Since it knows who was using it, it might record the kind of channels that you often watched and the level of volumes you liked. In other words, it would provide your way of using it. This would be a good sales pitch though it might be expensive."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6956}

{"pred": "The decision from the discussion is to have a remote control with a screen that will change depending on the user's preferences, with a minimum of three actions, and with the option to record and watch the history of actions.", "answers": ["The point of this discussion is that the group should optimize buttons and switch designs, adjust the number and size of buttons and their functions, filter out unnecessary functions, reduce the number of buttons and replace them with screens to enhance the applicability of remote controls, just like mobile phones."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3234}
{"pred": "The group plans to make the remote control universal for all brands and models of TVs and DVD players, with a simple and standard design that is easy to use and understand. They will also investigate the possibility of offering different fronts or faces for the remote, such as a pink front for young children, and will look into the technical design and form of the remote. Additionally, they will focus on the precision of the buttons and the look and feel of the remote's design.", "answers": ["They want to keep the cost under 12.50 euros by controlling the materials, and they want to sell them internationally for 25 euros, with a target of 50 million euros worldwide.

{"pred": "The discussion revolved around the idea of using speech recognition to allow users to select channels without using buttons. The team considered the option of using a remote control with a microphone to recognize the user's voice and automatically switch to the desired channel.

They also discussed the idea of using a clap or whistle to activate the channel, but concluded that it may not be universal and may not work for people without hands.", "answers": ["The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted. Then the user interface designer offered a solution that users could set up the channels that they often watched as one, two, and three so that they would never have to go through dozens of channels.
