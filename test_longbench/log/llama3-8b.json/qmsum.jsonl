And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to.

So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it’s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning well—no reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'.

So he wanted to create more word-specific um HMMs to start training from.

He wanted to compare that in the well-matched case to the unmatched case, and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models, you know, what's happening. He wanted to compare how they perform to that. But you know, it depends on what the actual application is and it's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have. He wanted to reduce the number of states for some of these shorter models that's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians. So in a sense it'll be a simpler system. He really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet, he was just gonna change the t length of the models and just see what happens.

The marketing expert also presented some graphs that showed the market share of different age groups and the preferences of the users for different features.

He said that the remote control should be able to control the television in a cordless way and should have some basic functions like on/off, channel selection, and volume control.
