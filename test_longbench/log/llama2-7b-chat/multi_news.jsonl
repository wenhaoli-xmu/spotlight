According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, exposure to cigarette smoke can make MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) more resistant to antibiotic treatment and harder to kill. The study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, leading to increased resistance against reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited.\n\nAnother study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became harder to kill. The study also found that the smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant to macrophage killing and better at invading human cells.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke may play a role in the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and that smokers may be more susceptible to infectious diseases.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been 50 cases of AFM reported across 24 states this year, double the number reported in 2015. The exact cause of AFM is still unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a variety of germs, such as enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. Related to enterovirus D68, an outbreak of AFM occurred in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December.\n\nThe symptoms of AFM are sudden and can include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM.\n\nIn August 2014, a cluster of AFM cases among children in Colorado was identified, and most patients were found to have distinctive abnormalities of the central spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging. Although the specific causes of this illness are still under investigation, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases.\n\nCaregivers should contact a healthcare provider if a child appears to have a sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs, and healthcare providers are encouraged to report patients meeting the case definition to their state or local health department.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse. This finding adds to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation also found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part, with some bloodstains tracing angles at odds with each other. The study's findings are consistent with the idea that the shroud is not a genuine religious relic, but rather a medieval artistic or didactic representation. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. The controversy surrounding the shroud's authenticity has been ongoing for centuries, with some claiming that it is the burial cloth of Jesus, while others argue that it is a medieval forgery.

The discovery provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their potential functions in dinosaurs.\n\nThe fossilized remains of Caihong juji show a combination of bird-like and non-avian dinosaur traits, including a bird-like body, feathers, and a crested head resembling that of a Velociraptor. The iridescent feathers are thought to have been used for display or social signaling, and the presence of melanosomes within the feathers suggests that they may have had a metallic sheen.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji is significant because it provides evidence that feathers evolved for display before they were adapted for flight. The find also highlights the diversity of feathered dinosaurs and their potential for complex social behaviors.\n\nThe study of Caihong juji is ongoing, and researchers hope to uncover more information about the species' ecology and behavior.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The lack of standardization in reporting missing persons cases to local and state organizations can lead to a patchwork of information that doesn't offer a full picture of the missing persons crisis in Humboldt County. Families of missing persons often have to take matters into their own hands and correspond with other families who have experienced similar situations to gather information and support. The story of Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner who went missing in 2014, highlights the challenges of searching for a missing person in Humboldt County, where the cannabis industry can create a dangerous and isolated environment. The sheriff's office has not commented on the specifics of Joseph's case, but the family has been doing their own investigative work and hiring private investigators. The story also highlights the importance of family members keeping in contact with law enforcement and encouraging others who might have information to come forward. Vikki Joseph, Jeff's sister, is determined to find out what happened to her brother and bring him home to Los Angeles County, where he can be laid to rest next to their mother.", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

The Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation, could lose an estimated $200 million a day and could see more than 700,000 jobs take a financial hit if the federal government shuts down. The economic impact could be significant, with child-care centers closing, mail delivery continuing, and Amtrak officials saying trains will continue to run. The region's economy is already weak, with across-the-board sequestration cuts costing the region 26,500 net jobs in August, and a shutdown could have real costs. Local governments have been setting aside pots of money in anticipation of a shutdown, but the impact on the region could be devastating. Lawmakers have passed legislation to continue paying active military members, but veterans' benefits could run out if a shutdown lasts more than a few weeks. The Congressional Research Service has reported that the 1996 federal government shutdowns shuttered national parks and monuments, stopped the processing of passport applications and the visa applications of foreigners, halted new patient enrollments in clinical trials at the NIH, and delayed work on bankruptcy and delinquent child-support cases. The D.C. region could be hit hard by lost income tax revenue from tens of thousands of idled federal workers, and local governments are looking at the possibility of tapping reserve funds.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains.

The probe will travel closer to the sun than any previous spacecraft, withstanding extreme temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission aims to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on Earth, shedding light on the mysterious corona and solar wind. The probe will carry a chip with photos of Eugene Parker, the astrophysicist who first predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958, and a plate carrying his message to the sun. The mission will also provide insight into the physics of stars, improve space weather forecasting, and help protect equipment from solar radiation. The Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with advanced heat shields and solar arrays that can retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun, keeping it at a safe temperature and powering it with the sun. The mission will trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The mission will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or closest point to the sun, and then repeat that flyby 23 more times over its lifetime. On the final orbits, the probe will fly within 9 solar radii, or seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun, of the sun's \"surface.\" The 20-day launch window opens July 31, 2018, and the spacecraft will arrive at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch after testing the assembly.

Such journeys were common around that time, reports Novinite. “Probably a pilgrim from the Foros Peninsula went on a pilgrimage to Ephesus, and came back here with this relic, which was then donated to the basilica on Foros,” says the director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History in Bulgaria.

The study's authors, astrophysicists Dr. Mike Brown and Dr. Konstantin Batygin, used advanced computer simulations to predict the existence of this unseen planet, which they call \"Planet Nine.\" According to the study, Planet Nine would have a mass similar to that of Uranus and Neptune combined, and its orbit would be highly eccentric, taking it as close as 200 astronomical units (AU) from the sun and as far as 1,000 AU from the sun. The researchers suggest that the gravitational influence of Planet Nine could explain the unusual orbits of some extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs), such as the Sedna and Eris. While the study's findings are intriguing, the authors caution that the evidence for Planet Nine is still circumstantial and requires further observation and verification.\n\nThe study has sparked significant interest in the scientific community, with some experts expressing skepticism about the findings and others calling for further research to confirm or refute the existence of Planet Nine. The search for Planet Nine is expected to continue with the help of new telescopes and observatories, which will be able to detect the planet directly through spectroscopy and astrometry.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would have significant implications for our understanding of the solar system's formation and evolution, as well as the potential for life on other planets. It would also raise questions about the status of Pluto, which was previously considered the ninth planet in our solar system but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nIn conclusion, while the existence of Planet Nine remains a topic of debate, the study by Brown and Batygin provides a fascinating insight into the possibility of a large, undiscovered planet in our solar system.

Ricks, who was the forecast coordinator for the Slidell office, needed to convey the urgency and seriousness of the situation to the public. He came up with a bold and effective forecast that included the now-famous words \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. PERHAPS LONGER. AT LEAST ONE HALF OF WELL-CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE. ALL GABLED ROOFS WILL FAIL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIVE TREES WILL BE SNAPPED OR UPROOTED. OTHERS WILL BE TOTALLY DEFOLIATED.\" Ricks' forecast was later put in the Smithsonian Museum of American History and is considered one of the most dire and effective weather forecasts ever issued by the National Weather Service.\n\nIn an interview with Brian Williams, Ricks discussed the experience of issuing the forecast and how he came to the conclusions he did. He stated that he would much rather have been wrong in this instance and that he was trying to validate each statement he made. Ricks also discussed how his document was right and that he is now back at work alongside co-workers who have no homes and are wearing the clothes they wore that day.\n\nThe interview also touched on the response to the hurricane and how it broke Ricks' heart because they always prepare for the big one, but they didn't think it was going to come this soon. The article also mentioned that Ricks' fellow forecaster, Gary Szatkowski, issued a personal plea during Hurricane Sandy's landfall in 2012 that included gut-wrenching statements like \"if you are still reluctant (to evacuate), think about your loved ones.\"\n\nOverall, the news passages highlight the importance of effective communication during emergency situations and the bravery and dedication of meteorologists like Ricks and Szatkowski who put themselves in the line of fire", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

{"pred": " In a recent article, scientists have proposed a new way to measure the energy consumption of advanced civilizations in the universe. According to Nikolai Kardashev, there are three types of advanced civilizations in the universe: Type I, which harnesses all the resources of a planet; Type II, which harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Type III, which harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. To reach these levels, civilizations would need to expand and harness energy from distant stars.\n\nOne proposed method for harnessing energy from distant stars is through the use of Dyson spheres, a swarm of satellites that surround a star and capture its energy. This would require a significant amount of material and would likely be unstable, so practical Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites.\n\nAnother proposal is to create a shell of satellites around a star to capture its energy. This would involve creating a cloud of satellites that would hover in space and collect energy from the star.\n\nScience fiction authors have also explored the idea of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from distant stars. In Olaf Stapledon's 1937 novel \"Star Maker,\" he describes a future civilization that surrounds their star with a gauze of light traps to focus the escaping solar energy for intelligent use. Similarly, in Freeman Dyson's 1960 scientific paper, he proposed that advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems to capture energy from distant stars.\n\nIn conclusion, as the universe expands, advanced civilizations may need to expand and harness energy from distant stars to survive. While these proposals are still in the realm of science fiction, they offer a glimpse into the possibilities of advanced civilizations in the universe.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved.

The study, which analyzed stone tools from the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, found that technologically advanced behaviors occurred much earlier than previously thought, around 300,000 years ago. This challenges the \"human revolution\" theory, which suggests that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly arose around 40,000-50,000 years ago.\n\nThe study found that hand axes, which were previously thought to be the hallmark of early human technology, were actually used for hunting and gathering for thousands of years. The researchers also discovered that the ancient humans of that time likely scavenged dead animals, as their heavy, clunky hand axes wouldn't have served well for hunting big game.\n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments, which is a symbol of early symbolic expression, dates back to around 300,000 years ago. This suggests that early humans had a complex culture and were aware of other groups and exchanged raw materials over longer distances.\n\nThe findings of this study challenge the traditional view of human evolution and suggest that modern human behavior may have emerged much earlier than previously thought. The discovery of advanced technologies and symbolic expression in early human populations raises questions about the origins of human cognition and culture.\n\nIn conclusion, the study provides new insights into the origins of modern human behavior and challenges the long-held belief that it emerged outside of Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

As the search for the plane continues, some experts are turning to an unlikely source for help: statisticians. In this article, we explore how Bayesian statistics, inspired by the 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, can be used to locate the missing plane.\n\nBayesian Statistics:\nBayesian statistics is a mathematical approach to probability that allows for the updating of probabilities based on new data or information. In the case of Flight MH370, statisticians can use historical data and theories about the crash to create a probability map of the possible locations of the plane. By applying Bayesian principles of probability to the available data, they can assess the likelihood of each location and prioritize the areas to search.\n\nAir France Flight 447:\nIn 2009, statisticians from Metron Inc. were called in to help locate the debris of Air France Flight 447, which had crashed into the Atlantic Ocean five days after taking off from Rio de Janeiro. Using Bayesian statistics, the team was able to simulate how the debris had traveled from the initial impact and calculate the most likely location of the plane.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the DNC's voter database. It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side.

{"pred": " According to a new report by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington-Seattle, obesity is a growing problem worldwide, with almost 30% of the global population either obese or overweight. The report, which analyzed data from 188 countries over the past three decades, found that obesity rates have risen significantly in both developed and developing countries. The USA leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the population being obese, followed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain. The report also found that obesity is more common in developed countries than in poorer nations, but it is rising in both. The most concerning trend is that there are no countries that have seen a decline in obesity rates over the past 30 years. The report lists several possible causes of obesity, including increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity, and changes in the mix of bacteria that live in human guts. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions. In related news, a recent study found that obesity is imposing an increasingly heavy burden on the world's population, with almost 2.1 billion people globally now either obese or overweight. The study also found that the richest country, the United States, was home to the biggest chunk of the planet's obese population. The researchers noted that obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. They also said that obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and that chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the popular uprising that forced him out of office in February 2011. His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, face corruption charges in the same case. The trial has been delayed due to procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. The prosecution will present its case over the next three days, with the possibility of Mubarak facing the death penalty if convicted. Mubarak is held in a hospital under custody, while his two sons are held in a prison south of Cairo. The trial has sparked speculation that a recent acquittal of policemen involved in the crackdown on protesters may be part of a broader effort to shield Mubarak and his associates from accountability. The outcome of the trial is closely watched by Egyptians and the international community, with many hoping it will bring justice and closure to the era of Mubarak's rule.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.
