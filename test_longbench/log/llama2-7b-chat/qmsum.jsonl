The expert also mentions that trends in the industry seem to be moving faster than the lifespan of remote controls, and therefore, it's important to keep up with these trends to stay competitive in the market.", "answers": ["The marketing expert came up with the idea that the remote control could identify the user.

The project manager has asked the group to work on these ideas and come up with a decision on which functions to include and how to design them within the next 30 minutes.", "answers": ["The point of this discussion is that the group should optimize buttons and switch designs, adjust the number and size of buttons and their functions, filter out unnecessary functions, reduce the number of buttons and replace them with screens to enhance the applicability of remote controls, just like mobile phones."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3234}
