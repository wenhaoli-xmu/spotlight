It was a really good idea. It was really good to make a baby-proof remote control. It got to be a titanium. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. We can put all the options into this screen. We'll need only few buttons. All the other things can be controlled through the screen.

He said that it identified that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it's the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment, that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer. That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples, I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying, but what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October, we're hoping to see the final report in October, will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. So, it's having a positive effect. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to £250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit", "answers": ["Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized that the focus was on registered licensed providers, for the childcare offer wanted to have a higher quality and provided wider aspects than single childcare.
