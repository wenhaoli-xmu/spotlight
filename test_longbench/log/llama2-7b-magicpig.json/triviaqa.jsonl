Up to 180,000 spectators a day entered the Park to enjoy the Games, making it the principal focus of Olympic activity.\nThe main venues ‚Äì the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre, Velodrome and BMX Circuit, as well as the hockey, handball and basketball arenas ‚Äì were easily accessible through a network of footbridges and walkways within the Park.\nThe Olympic Village was within walking distance of all the venues in the Park, enhancing the experience for athletes and officials. The use of other prestigious venues ‚Äì such as Wembley Stadium for football, the All-England Club in Wimbledon for tennis, Lord‚Äôs Cricket Ground for archery and Horse Guards Parade for beach volleyball ‚Äì was also a feature of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nThe London 2012 Games included a four-year Cultural Olympiad.

For these Games, the figure of victory is accompanied by the specific inscription: ‚Äú XXX Olympiad London 2012 ‚Äù.\nThe reverse features an abstract design with the 2012 Games emblem at its centre as a metaphor for the modern city. The design also includes a ribbon representing London‚Äôs Thames river and an interlocking grid pattern that radiates from the centre and pulls the design together, giving it a sense of outreach while also representing the achievements and efforts of Olympic athletes. A square, which encases the balance of the design, opposes the circular shape of the medals and emphasizes the sense of ‚Äòplace, as in a map inset.\nMore info\nWenlock\nWenlock takes his name from the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire, which still hosts the traditional Much Wenlock Games.

Contemporaneously described as the \"war to end all wars\", more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war, a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.\n\nThe war drew in all the world's economic great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Allies (based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire) and the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary, it did not join the war until five months after its outbreak, in May 1915. These alliances both reorganised and in some cases reinforced their alliance agreements among other powers.\n\nMore than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.
