They also demonstrate that the improved relation detector enables their simple KBQA system to achieve state-of-the-art results on both single-relation and multi-relation KBQA tasks.\n\nQuestion: What is the main idea of the proposed model?\n\nAnswer: The main idea of the proposed model is to improve KB relation detection to cope", "answers": ["SimpleQuestions, WebQSP", "WebQSP, SimpleQuestions"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4524}
