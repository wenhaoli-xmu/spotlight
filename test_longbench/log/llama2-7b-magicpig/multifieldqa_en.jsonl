The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers on order. The service has 32 amphibious warfare ships and more than 280,000 personnel on active duty and 101,476 in the Navy Reserve. Over 272,000 members of the U.S. Navy are stationed aboard naval vessels worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was essentially disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. It played a major role in the American Civil War, in the World War I era, and in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence, deploying in warfare, training, and humanitarian operations. It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward areas such as the Mediterranean Sea, and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it an active player in U.S. foreign and defense policy.\n\nThe Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is itself a division of the Department of Defense, which is headed by the Secretary of Defense. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is a four-star admiral and the senior naval officer of the Department of the Navy. The CNO is assisted by the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (DCNO), who is a three-star admiral and head of Naval Operations staff. The Navy is part of the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the Secretary of the Navy.
