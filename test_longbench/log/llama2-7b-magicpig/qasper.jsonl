Because we do not change the neural network architecture to integrate simplified corpora, our method can be easily applied to other NTS systems. We expect that the effectiveness of our method not only varies with the quality of the NTS system used for back-translation, but also depends on the amount of available parallel and simplified corpora. In the paper, we have only utilized data from Wikipedia for simplified sentences. In the future, many other text sources are available and the impact of not only size, but also of domain should be investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "answers": ["training set has 89,042 sentence pairs, and the test set has 100 pairs, training set contains 296,402, 2,000 for development and 359 for testing", "WikiSmall  89 142 sentence pair and  WikiLarge 298 761 sentence pairs.
