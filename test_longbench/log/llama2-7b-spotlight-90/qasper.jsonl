{"pred": "\n\nThe authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models and optimization techniques by conducting a survey among engineers and identifying a spectrum of three typical personas. To satisfy the requirements of all the above three personas, the NLP toolkit has to be generic enough to cover as many tasks as possible. At the same time, it also needs to be flexible enough to allow alternative network architectures as well as customized modules. Therefore, the authors analyzed the NLP jobs submitted to a commercial centralized GPU cluster.

For the KBQA evaluation, we also start with their entity linking results.
