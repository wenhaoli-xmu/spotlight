And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frame—that is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now.\n\nQuery: What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed?\nAnswer: Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it’s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning well—no reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. So, I don't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care.\n\nQuery", "answers": ["Vaughan Gething pointed out that due to the school lockdown, children as well as their parents would face difficulties at home learning and social-contacting.

So, we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services.\n\nQuery: What did Julie Morgan elaborate on the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round?\nAnswer: Julie Morgan AM: Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. Also, there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities. There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children's services. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. So, there's very close contact. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can.

He started looking to and now he's I'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back-end in order to try to uh to improve it. So. One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models and so I went on-line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits and just looked at, you know, the number of phones in each one of the digits. Um you know, sort of the canonical way of setting up an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone and um so then the total number of states for a word would just be, you know, the number of phones times three. And so when I did that for the Italian digits, I got a number of states, ranging on the low end from nine to the high end, eighteen. Um. Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there's an initial null and a final null so when they use uh models that have eighteen states, there're really sixteen states. They've got those initial and final null states. And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits, the four and five which um, according to my, you know, sort of off the cuff calculation, should have eighteen states each. And so they had sixteen. So that's pretty close. Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter. So the majority of them wanna have nine states. And so theirs are s sort of twice as long. So my guess about what's happening is that um you know, if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have, you know, half as much training data", "answers": ["PhD B focused on Italian and experimented with the number of states for different words.
